# Pharmacutical Drug Online Ratings
## Overview
I wanted to take a look at the user ratings of brand-name drugs versus their generic counterpart. This could be used to help identify if getting the brand name version is worth the extra money or from a pharmacutical company perspective, how well their brand is doing compared to the other brands and the generic.

All of this information is from the Drug Review Dataset which publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. The data was taken from Drugs.com, an online pharmacutical website that allows it's users to rate the medication they have taken.

## The Data
There are 215,063 reviews in the dataset. Each review includes drug name, condition it was given to treat, a written review, a rating out of 10, the date and a count of other users who found the review helpful. I seperated the data by condition and took a look at the top 5 conditions that were reviewed.
